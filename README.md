# Java Character Counting Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the Java Collections API to count the frequency of each character in a given string. It's a simple yet effective way to showcase the power of Java's data structures in processing and analyzing text data.

## Features

- **Character Frequency Count**: Counts the frequency of each character in the provided string.
- **Case Insensitive Counting**: Optionally, counts characters in a case-insensitive manner.

## Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or above.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/username/char-count-java.git`
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: `cd char-count-java`

## Usage

To run the program, compile the Java files and then run the main class. You can provide the string via standard input.


## How It Works

The program uses a `HashMap<Character, Integer>` to store the count of each character. It iterates over each character in the string, checks if it is already in the map, and updates the count accordingly.
