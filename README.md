#Java Character Counting Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Java Collections API to count the frequency of each character in a given string. It's a simple yet effective way to showcase the power of Java's data structures in processing and analyzing text data.

#Features
Character Frequency Count: Counts the frequency of each character in the provided string.
Case Insensitive Counting: Optionally, counts characters in a case-insensitive manner.

#How It Works
The program uses a HashMap<Character, Integer> to store the count of each character. It iterates over each character in the string, checks if it is already in the map, and updates the count accordingly.
